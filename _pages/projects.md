            <a class="display-4 project-title" href="https://github.com/Alvarohf/DamGeneticSystem">Finding maximum and minimum elevation in a map with genetic algorithms</a>
            <p>This system is able to get the minimum or maximum in a map using Google Maps API, software patterns and different genetic algorithms techniques. It is integrated in a web page that allows you to use it.</p>

            <a class="display-4 project-title" href="https://github.com/Alvarohf/Minimax-python-game">Minimax python game made with pygame</a>
            <p>A game of cutting blocks implemented with a minimax algorithm wich have a custom user interface created with pygame to play against the AI, it lets you choose your cut and see the visual representation of the block, switching colors in each round to see your turn.</p>

            <a class="display-4 project-title" href="https://github.com/Alvarohf/2048-CUDA-Scala">2048 game implemented with NVIDIA CUDA</a>
            <p>2048 is a game that got popular on mobile phones, it consisted in joining the same numbers to make one bigger until you can't move more and you get blocked. In this case, it was implemented in C and CUDA and finally in Scala. Trying to optimize it and simulate over big 2D arrays.</p>

            <a class="display-4 project-title" href="https://github.com/Alvarohf/Racket-cities-graph-search-algorithms">Racket graph search with visualizations</a>
            <p>It is a variant of the mailman problem used in search in graphs, it has been done using the functional language Racket with a visualization made in GraphViz. It implements depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search and bidirectional search to solve the problem.</p>

            <a class="display-4 project-title" href="https://github.com/Alvarohf/UAH_HelperBot">UAH Helper bot (UAH Hackathon)</a>
            <p>We developed a Telegram bot in the UAH Help Hackathon, wich was able to share teacher schedules, info about the university food in the cafeteria, about sport competitions and cultural activities. All of this with real data, finishing with a real test that the judges could try in real time during our presentation. This project was choosed as winner of the hackathon.</p>
