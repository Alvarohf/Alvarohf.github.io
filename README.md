# My personal website
It is a mix between a blog and a personal page where you could see more info about me, posts and my work. It is hosted with Github pages and it is implemented using a modified template in Jekyll (ideal for Github) with advanced features and 100% FREE :dollar:.

I am open for any question about the web or any project if you are interested.
## About me :moyai:
Here you can check where I am working at the moment, what I have done in other companies, my education and social work to improve the world.
## Posts :newspaper:
As a geek I love to read tech news, discover cool projects, do some investigation about something and learn new things. But I don't want to keep all of these to me so I want to share with you by writing posts on the web where you can share your opinion.

Thank you and enjoy it!
